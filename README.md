About me

I am security professional. I hold two undergrad degrees: one in Molecular and Microbiology and the other one in Biotechnology. I recently pursue a Master of Science degree in Data Science at Bellevue University. After working in security for over a decade, I think now is a good time to switch career due to the up rising demand that I notice for Data Scientists. I truly believe that it is a career that can help reach my goals.
